    <h1>Will you be my Girlfriend?</h1>
</head>
<body>
    Now i didn't just want to presnt you with just this webpage alone so i may have maybe, possibly written you a little poem... <br>
   <h2 align="center">Bliss</h2>
<section ALIGN="CENTER">
What could be described as emotion <br>
Holding no conclusion to the sound of inclination <br>
Was found in her speech as she preached sounds of gold <br>
I sought composure but my lips refused to hold <br>
<br>

<br>
I had realized, before my eyes sat and Angel <br>
Soft alluring aura calling my name from a distance cut short <br>
Was I in heaven ? Or answering for my sins?  <br>
I couldn’t explain <br>
<br>
Her eyes would shine as vibrations escaped her lips <br>
Who are you from whence have you come ? <br>
Static through my body giving the signal of the time I held in the back of my mind <br>
<br>
Please God, let this meet no end for I have fallen too deep <br>
Every word softly grasped my heart as the race began <br>
Is this love ? Or a mirage ?  <br>
No tis not fake this is the world <br>
<br>
I had been blessed with a piece falling straight from the heavens <br>
Eternal gratitude stretching longer than the latitude of Mother Earth <br>
<br>
This piece was the other to my heart <br>
I heard it, I was told by the tone <br>
Sweet, comforting, sober all mixed to create the euphoric amber <br>
<br>
Alas I’m happy as the feelings in my heart were reciprocated by the other <br>
And the sweet tone would stay with me for a little while longer <br>
<br>
Thank you lord
